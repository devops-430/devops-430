## DAY - 01
1. We tried to create a VPC using a CloudFormation template, and explored concepts like parameters, outputs, mappings, and referencing parameters inside resources.
2. We also discussed applying changes using ChangeSets or directly updating the stack.

## DAY - 02
1. We need to create and deploy the following resources as part of a single stack:
   1. Provision a VPC with both private and public subnets, as well as security groups.
   2. Set up the frontend on S3.
   3. Launch an EC2 instance with a userdata script to deploy the PHP stack.

## DAY - 03
1. Create an infrastructure provisioning pipeline that can accommodate dynamic requirements. Users will be able to input parameters into the pipeline, and it will deploy accordingly.

## ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:
1. CloudFront
2. Load Balancer
3. Route 53
4. Amplify
5. CloudWatch
